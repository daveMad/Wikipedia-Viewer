## Architecture

This project does not contain back-end code. It is just an Angular app

- src folder
    - index.html is the entry point. It contains our selector for the *root component*
    - *polyfills.ts* contains the importing statements of es6 modules
    - *main.ts* imports our module and components, also bootstraps the **AppModule**

- src/app folder
    - *app.module.ts* declares our AppModule that also imports the needed Angular Modules and our root component. There is only the root component used in the app.
    - *app.service.ts* is an **Angular service**,decorated as `@Injectable()` it makes http requests to [Wikipedia Api](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) and returns the resulting data
    - *app.component.ts* is our root component file, decorated with `@NgComponent()`, it imports the **AppService** and uses to it to make http requests
    - *rxjs-extensions.ts* imports es6 rxjs modules. In **AppService** we use observables to return our data, and these modules are required to use the observable data
    - *app.component.html* and *app.component.css*
    is our template and style files that'll be embed on the index.html file
